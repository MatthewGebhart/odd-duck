## "New Product Voting interface"

A Simple voting interface that allows the user to select between 3 images representing potential new products that could be produced by Odd Duck Product Company

Images will not repeat between voting rounds to avoid user selection bias

After 25 "rounds" of voting, images are removed and the user is given the following options via buttons:

- "View Results" to see a bar chart with the number of clicks each potential product gained as well as the number of times it was viewed by the user.
- "Vote Again" which will refresh the page allowing the user to perform another session of 25 rounds of voting. Vote counts and view counts will be maintained from previous rounds.
- "Clear Results and Vote Again" will delete the local storage before refreshing the page so votes and views will both be set to zero.
